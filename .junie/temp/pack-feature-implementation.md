# Pack Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a new "Pack..." feature analogous to the existing "Unpack..." feature, allowing users to create compressed archives from selected files and directories.

## Frontend Implementation

### Data Models (libs/fnf-data/src/models/pack/)
- `PackDialogData`: Data structure for the pack dialog
- `PackDialogResultData`: Result data from the pack dialog
- `PackParaData`: Parameter data for pack operations

### Dialog Component (apps/fnf/src/app/component/cmd/pack/)
- `PackDialogComponent`: Main dialog component with form fields for:
  - Target filename (with automatic extension adjustment)
  - Target directory (with suggestion menu)
  - Password (optional)
  - Format selection (7z, zip, tar, gzip)
  - Compression level (0-9)
- `PackDialogService`: Service for opening the pack dialog
- HTML template with Material Design components
- CSS styling for responsive layout

### Integration
- Added `OPEN_PACK_DLG` action to action enum
- Added "Pack..." label to action labels
- Added button enable states for pack action
- Integrated with file table component for action handling
- Added to action execution service

## Backend Implementation

### Pack Function (apps/fnf-api/src/app/file-action/action/pack.fn.ts)
- Uses node-7z library for compression
- Supports multiple formats: 7z, zip, tar, gzip
- Handles password protection
- Configurable compression levels
- Proper error handling and logging

### Service Integration
- Added `pack` command to FileCmd type
- Added pack function to FileService
- Added ACTION_PACK to ActionQueueService
- Added createQueueActionEventForPack to CommandService

## Features

### Supported Formats
- **7-Zip (.7z)**: Best compression, password support
- **ZIP (.zip)**: Universal compatibility, password support
- **TAR (.tar)**: No compression, no password
- **GZIP (.tar.gz)**: Good compression, no password

### User Interface
- Shows selected files/directories count and size
- Automatic filename generation with timestamp
- Directory suggestion menu from recent/favorite locations
- Real-time format extension adjustment
- Form validation for required fields

### Backend Processing
- Asynchronous processing via task queue
- Progress tracking and status updates
- Error handling and user feedback
- Support for multiple source files/directories

## Usage
1. Select files/directories in the file manager
2. Click "Pack..." button or use keyboard shortcut
3. Configure archive settings in the dialog
4. Click "Pack" to start compression
5. Monitor progress in the job queue

## Technical Details
- Uses existing task queue system for background processing
- Integrates with existing file action infrastructure
- Follows established patterns from unpack functionality
- Maintains consistency with application architecture
