# Download Feature Implementation

## Overview
The "Download..." feature has been successfully implemented, allowing users to download single files or create compressed archives for multiple files/directories.

## Frontend Implementation

### Components Created
- **DownloadDialogComponent** (`apps/fnf/src/app/component/cmd/download/download-dialog.component.ts`)
  - Handles both single file and multiple file download scenarios
  - For single files: Shows file info and download button
  - For multiple files: Shows form with archive options (filename, directory, password, format, compression level)
  - Uses Angular's new control flow syntax (`@if`, `@for`)
  - Integrates with `WalkdirService` for file/folder scanning

### Services Created
- **DownloadService** (`apps/fnf/src/app/service/download.service.ts`)
  - Handles POST requests to backend for file downloads
  - Uses `forRoot` configuration pattern like `ServershellAutocompleteService`
  - Returns `Observable<Blob>` for file streaming

### Data Models
- **DownloadDialogData** (`libs/fnf-data/src/models/pack/download-dialog.data.ts`)
- **DownloadDialogResultData** (`libs/fnf-data/src/models/pack/download-dialog-result.data.ts`)
- **DownloadParaData** (`libs/fnf-data/src/models/pack/download-para.data.ts`)

### Integration Points
- Added `OPEN_DOWNLOAD_DLG` action handling in `FileTableComponent`
- Added button enable states for download action
- Updated environment configuration for download service
- Added download service to app configuration

## Backend Implementation

### Download Function
- **download.fn.ts** (`apps/fnf-api/src/app/file-action/action/download.fn.ts`)
  - Handles single file streaming directly to response
  - Creates temporary archives for multiple files using `node-7z`
  - Supports multiple formats: 7z, ZIP, TAR, GZIP
  - Includes password protection and compression level options
  - Proper cleanup of temporary files

### API Endpoint
- **POST /api/do/download** in `FileActionController`
  - Accepts `DownloadDialogResultData`
  - Converts to `FilePara` format for processing
  - Streams file/archive directly to client

### Integration
- Added `download` command to `FileCmd` type
- Added download function to `FileService` command map
- Updated environment configuration

## Features

### Single File Download
- Direct file streaming with original filename
- No additional options needed
- Fast and efficient

### Multiple File Archive Download
- Configurable archive format (7z, ZIP, TAR, GZIP)
- Password protection support
- Compression level selection (0-9)
- Custom filename and directory selection
- Directory suggestions from recent/favorite locations

### User Experience
- File/folder count and size display
- Real-time scanning with `WalkdirService`
- Form validation for required fields
- Error handling and user feedback
- Automatic filename extension management

## Technical Details

### Frontend
- Uses Angular Material components for consistent UI
- Reactive forms with validation
- OnPush change detection for performance
- TypeScript strict typing throughout

### Backend
- NestJS controller with proper error handling
- File streaming for efficient downloads
- Temporary file management with cleanup
- Support for large files and directories

### Data Flow
1. User selects files/folders and clicks "Download..."
2. Dialog shows file info and options (if multiple files)
3. User configures download settings
4. Frontend sends POST request to `/api/do/download`
5. Backend processes request and streams file/archive
6. Browser triggers download with configured filename

## Usage

### Single File
1. Select a file in the file table
2. Click "Download..." button
3. File downloads with original name

### Multiple Files/Directories
1. Select multiple files/directories
2. Click "Download..." button
3. Configure archive settings:
   - Target filename (with appropriate extension)
   - Target directory (with suggestions)
   - Password (optional)
   - Format (7z, ZIP, TAR, GZIP)
   - Compression level
4. Click "Download" to create and download archive

## Configuration

### Environment Settings
```typescript
download: {
  downloadUrl: "/api/download" // or "http://localhost:3333/api/download" for dev
}
```

### Service Configuration
```typescript
DownloadService.forRoot(environment.download);
```

## Dependencies
- `node-7z` for archive creation
- `7zip-bin` for 7-Zip binary
- Angular Material for UI components
- NestJS for backend API

## Error Handling
- File not found errors
- Permission errors
- Archive creation failures
- Network errors
- Invalid input validation

## Future Enhancements
- Progress indicators for large downloads
- Resume interrupted downloads
- Batch download queue
- Download history
- Custom archive filters/exclusions
