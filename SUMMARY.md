# Setting Up OpenAI API Key in WebStorm - Summary

## Problem

You needed a way to set the `FNF_OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable in WebStorm without checking it into version
control.

## Solution Implemented

1. **Created Template Files**:
    - Created `.env.example` as a template file that shows what environment variables are needed but doesn't contain
      actual secrets
    - This file should be committed to version control

2. **Created Local Environment File**:
    - Created `.env` file for storing actual environment variables
    - This file is already included in `.gitignore` and won't be committed to version control
    - You should replace the placeholder value with your actual OpenAI API key

3. **Documentation**:
    - Created `SETUP_ENV_VARS.md` with detailed instructions on how to set up environment variables in WebStorm
    - This includes multiple methods to choose from based on your preference

## How to Use

1. Edit the `.env` file and replace `your_actual_FNF_OPENAI_API_KEY_here` with your actual OpenAI API key:
   ```
   FNF_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-key-here
   ```

2. WebStorm will automatically load these environment variables when you run your application, as long as your
   application is configured to read from `.env` files (which is common in Node.js applications).

3. For more detailed instructions, refer to `SETUP_ENV_VARS.md`.

## Verification

- The `.env` file is properly ignored by git (confirmed with `git status`)
- The environment files (`environment.ts` and `environment.prod.ts`) are already set up to use the `FNF_OPENAI_API_KEY`
  environment variable

## Next Steps

1. If you want to commit the template and documentation files to your repository:
   ```bash
   git add .env.example SETUP_ENV_VARS.md SUMMARY.md
   git commit -m "Add environment variable setup documentation"
   ```

2. Make sure to keep your `.env` file secure and never commit it to version control.
